# Heart-Attack-Analysis-and-Prediction
Worked on Heart Attack Dataset on Kaggle<br>
Visualised the dataset to get better insights of the problem<br>
Concluded that higher age, higher cholestrol levels and higher heart rate leads to heart attack<br>
Applied machine learning models like SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest resulting in 90% test accuracy
